/*************************** midiCallback() *****************************
 * Here's my callback that Windows calls whenever 1 of 4 possible things
 * happen:
 *
 * 1).	I open a MIDI In Device via midiInOpen(). In this case, the
 *		uMsg arg to my callback will be MIM_OPEN. The handle arg will
 *		be the same as what is returned from midiInOpen(). The
 *		dwInstance arg is whatever I passed to midiInOpen() as its
 *		dwInstance arg.
 *
 * 2).	I close a MIDI In Device via midiInClose(). In this case, the
 *		uMsg arg to my callback will be MIM_CLOSE. The handle arg will
 *		be the same as what was passed to midiInClose(). The
 *		dwInstance arg is whatever I passed to midiInClose() as its
 *		dwInstance arg when I initially opened this handle.
 *
 * 3).	One, regular (ie, everything except System Exclusive messages) MIDI
 *		message has been completely input. In this case, the uMsg arg to my
 *		callback will be MIM_DATA. The handle arg will be the same as what
 *		is passed to midiInOpen(). The dwInstance arg is whatever I passed
 *		to midiInOpen() as its dwInstance arg when I initially opened this
 *		handle. The dwParam1 arg is the bytes of the MIDI Message packed
 *		into an unsigned long in the same format that is used by
 *		midiOutShort(). The dwParam2 arg is a time stamp that the device
 *		driver created when it recorded the MIDI message.
 *
 * 4).	midiInOpen has either completely filled a MIDIHDR's memory buffer
 *		with part of a System Exclusive message (in which case we had better
 *		continue queuing the MIDIHDR again in order to grab the remainder
 *		of the System Exclusive), or the MIDIHDR's memory buffer contains the
 *		remainder of a System Exclusive message (or the whole message if it
 *		happened to fit into the memory buffer intact). In this case, the
 *		uMsg arg to my callback will be MIM_LONGDATA. The handle arg will be
 *		the same as what is passed to midiInOpen(). The dwInstance arg is
 *		whatever I passed to midiInOpen() as its dwInstance arg when I
 *		initially opened this handle. The dwParam1 arg is a pointer to the
 *		MIDIHDR whose memory buffer contains the System Exclusive data. The
 *		dwParam2 arg is a time stamp that the device driver created when it
 *		recorded the MIDI message.
 *
 * 5).	This callback is not processing data fast enough such that the MIDI
 *		driver (and possibly the MIDI In port itself) has had to throw away
 *		some incoming, regular MIDI messages. In this case, the uMsg arg to my
 *		callback will be MIM_MOREDATA. The handle arg will be the same as what
 *		is passed to midiInOpen(). The dwInstance arg is whatever I passed
 *		to midiInOpen() as its dwInstance arg when I initially opened this
 *		handle. The dwParam1 arg is the bytes of the MIDI Message that was
 *		not handled (by an MIM_DATA call) packed into an unsigned long in the
 *		same format that is used by midiOutShort(). The dwParam2 arg is a time
 *		stamp that the device driver created when it recorded the MIDI message.
 *		In handling a series of these events, you should store the MIDI data
 *		in a global buffer, until such time as you receive another MIM_DATA
 *		(which indicates that you can now do the more time-consuming processing
 *		that you obviously were doing in handling MIM_DATA).
 *		NOTE: Windows sends an MIM_MOREDATA event only if you specify the
 *		MIDI_IO_STATUS flag to midiInOpen().
 *
 * 6).	An invalid, regular MIDI message was received. In this case, the uMsg
 *		arg to my callback will be MIM_ERROR. The handle arg will be the same
 *		as what is passed to midiInOpen(). The dwInstance arg is whatever I
 *		passed to midiInOpen() as its dwInstance arg when I initially opened
 *		this handle. The dwParam1 arg is the bytes of the MIDI Message that was
 *		not handled (by an MIM_DATA call) packed into an unsigned long in the
 *		same format that is used by midiOutShort(). The dwParam2 arg is a time
 *		stamp that the device driver created when it recorded the MIDI message.
 *
 * 7).	An invalid, System Exclusive message was received. In this case, the uMsg
 *		arg to my callback will be MIM_LONGERROR. The handle arg will be the same
 *		as what is passed to midiInOpen(). The dwInstance arg is whatever I
 *		passed to midiInOpen() as its dwInstance arg when I initially opened
 *		this handle. The dwParam1 arg is a pointer to the MIDIHDR whose memory
 *		buffer contains the System Exclusive data. The dwParam2 arg is a time
 *		stamp that the device driver created when it recorded the MIDI message.
 *
 * The time stamp is expressed in terms of milliseconds since your app
 * called midiInStart().
